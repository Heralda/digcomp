            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello!  I'm Gabi, please let me join your project!  I am a floppy haired junior with a few useful skills, a very large dog, and, now, a Github pages site. This site will hopefully give you an idea
            of if and how I can contribute to your collaborative project.  I've decided to pitch myself (rather than pitching a project) for a few reasons, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>to make an alternative resume</li>
                <li>to incorporate social media</li>
                <li>to learn flexbox styling</li>
                <li>to practice creating something for other people</li>

            <div><p>As may be clear from my presence in class, I really like digital media.  I think a lot of people our age do too, but we're sometimes hesitant to learn
            how to use tools that can help us convey our ideas.  It's really disappointing to see that, because most of the things we want to use can be learned by Googling it.  My main talent in digital media, I think, is Googling.  More conventionally, this is called research (but we all just start with Google, let's be honest).</p>
                <p>My current research project maps the places referenced in British newspaper articles about the 1857 Indian Rebellion.  I'm excited to gain some experience with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), as I'm a little bit obsessed with maps.  My older research projects will be linked to below.  My personal interests include crime novels and podcasts, hanging out with my dog and guinea pig, and Wikipedia spiraling.  If you've never done that before, may I recommend starting with the wiki entry for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A4vle_goat">the GÃ¤vle Christmas goat</a>.</p></div>
