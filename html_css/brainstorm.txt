My goal in my email was to improve my DH sites that exist already, but I think I'd really rather learn some more Javascript.  I've used it once and I couldn't get it to work in a time crunch.
Can you use javascript on a Github pages site?  I know generally the support is less than stellar, and I've had trouble with it occasionally in the past.
I do have to build a website that includes Javascript (but not that I have to write myself, GIS javascript) this semester, so I don't necesssarily want to build something else myself.  I honestly feel like maybe I will be more useful to myself and my peers if I am on someone else's project.  I know HTML and CSS, including using flexboxes, really well already.  So rather than create something myself I feel like it might be useful for me to help someone else fulfill, and then extend the goals for what they want to create.  

I would love to help someone else make their project goals happen.  I want to do more freelance/consulting work in the future, so the best way I could do that would be to prove to you that my digital media skills are solid.  I took this class to introduce myself to new digital media and enhance my existing skills, so I'm excited to show how I did that.
